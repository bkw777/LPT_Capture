This is a rendition of [LptCap](https://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~heha/basteln/PC/LptCap/index.en.htm)

Differences:  
* Source in KiCAD instead of Eagle
* SSOP chip instead of QFN
* 0805 passives instead of 0603
* MicroUSB, in a cut-out
* Snap-together backshell instead of screws & nuts
* Tie the Select line high
* Use VBUS/VCC instead of 3V3OUT for pullups
* VBUS & VCC conditioning per FT245RL datasheet

PCB: [OSHPark](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/55M38fT9), [PCBWAY](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/LPT_Capture.html)  
BOM: [DigiKey](https://www.digikey.com/short/33jw5t4p)

The hole in the backshell is 11mm. Most cables with small oval heads will fit.  
The BOM includes a cable which you can remove if you don't need it.  
For a common example, a [Raspberry Pi cable](https://thepihut.com/collections/raspberry-pi-cables/products/raspberry-pi-micro-usb-cable) fits.
